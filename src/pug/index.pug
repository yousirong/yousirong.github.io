        | Hello, I am June-yong Lee, currently pursuing a master&apos;s degree in computer engineering
        | at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies. I am interested in applying diffusion models to autonomous driving research,
        | with a particular focus on deep learning computer vision, generative AI, and multimodal AI.
        | One of my research papers, titled &quot;Lightweight Temporal Segment Network for Video Scene Understanding:
        | Validation of Driver Assault Detection,&quot;
        | was published in the Journal of the Korean Institute of Information Scientists and Engineers (KIISE).
        | I also have experience developing and deploying responsive web interfaces for web crawling servers,
        | making me proficient in frontend, backend, and web crawling technologies.
        | My current research interests include transformer-based diffusion models.

          .subheading.mb-3 Korean Institute of Information Scientists and Engineers - Journal of KIISE(JOK)
          p
            | There has been increasing number of driver assaults in transportation such as taxis and buses in the past years.
            | It can be especially difficult to respond quickly to assaults on drivers by drunks late at night.
            | To address this issue, our research team proposes a lightweight CNN-based Temporal Segment Network (TSN) model,
            | which can detect driver assaults by passengers in real time.
            | The TSN model efficiently processes videos by sampling a small number of image frames and is divided into two streams for learning:
            | one for spatial information processing and the other for temporal information processing.
            | Convolutional neural networks are employed in each stream. In this research,
            | we apply a lightweight CNN architecture, MobileOne, significantly reducing the model size while demonstrating improved accuracy even with limited computing resources.
            | The model is expected to contribute to rapid response and prevention of hazardous situations for drivers by being integrated into vehicular driver monitoring systems.

          p
            | Although large corporations have established sales databases for efficient sales
            | activities, small-scale entrepreneurs need a system that provides an interface that anyone
            | can easily manage, offering diverse and complex information. This paper proposes the use
            | of React technology, which can also operate on crawling servers that automatically collect
            | store information.
            | Furthermore, it suggests the development of a responsive web user interface that can be conveniently used in both mouse
            | and keyboard-based desktop environments as well as touch-based smartphone environments,
            | utilizing React technology for theeffective delivery of various data. The proposed methods anticipate rapid retrieval of large
            | volumes of data due to the adoption of asynchronous function processing in React technology,
            | an improvement over traditional JavaScript methods.
