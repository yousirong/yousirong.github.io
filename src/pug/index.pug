              h3.mb-0 ADPDiT: A Multimodal Diffusion Transformer for Predicting Alzheimer's Disease Progression and Generating Brain Image
              .subheading.mb-3 Journal undecided
              p
                | ADPDiT (Alzheimer's Disease Progression Diffusion Transformer) is a novel multimodal framework that integrates brain MRI data with structured clinical metadata to predict Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression and generate personalized, progression-conditioned brain images. AI-based AD diagnosis using MRI requires longitudinal imaging data capturing disease state transitions over time. However, clinical practice faces significant challenges: patients may skip scheduled MRI appointments, and many datasets predominantly contain images from single disease states rather than progressive sequences. To address these limitations, ADPDiT employs predictive generation capabilities that can synthesize missing temporal MRI data, potentially enhancing existing AD prediction systems by providing continuous disease progression visualization. The model addresses the limitations of conventional single-modality diagnostic approaches by employing a diffusion transformer architecture with specialized cross-attention modules that effectively fuse patient-specific neuroimaging features with comprehensive clinical data. The core architecture features ADPDiTBlocks with self-attention, cross-attention, and feed-forward networks, utilizing Flash Attention optimization and Query-Key normalization for enhanced computational efficiency. The model incorporates 2D Rotary Position Encoding (RoPE) for spatial-aware image token processing and attention pooling mechanisms to integrate multi-scale clinical information. The framework operates on 256×256 resolution brain MRI slices, which are processed into patch embeddings within a VAE-based latent space. Training data comprises 619 unique patients from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset, with 226,434 brain MRI slices distributed as: 341 mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients, 141 AD patients, and 137 cognitively normal (CN) individuals. Clinical metadata includes comprehensive neuropsychological assessments (CDRSB, ADAS11, ADAS13, MMSE, RAVLT, MOCA, FAQ) embedded through learned representations and integrated via attention pooling, making it a comprehensive tool for AD research and precision medicine applications in neurodegenerative disease management.

              h3.mb-0 Lightweight Temporal Segment Network for Video Scene Understanding: Validation in Driver Assault Detection
              .subheading.mb-3 Korean Institute of Information Scientists and Engineers - Journal of KIISE(JOK)
              p
                | There has been an increasing number of driver assaults in transportation such as taxis and buses in the past years. It can be especially difficult to respond quickly to assaults on drivers by drunks late at night. To address this issue, our research team proposes a lightweight CNN-based Temporal Segment Network (TSN) model, which can detect driver assaults by passengers in real time. The TSN model efficiently processes videos by sampling a small number of image frames and is divided into two streams for learning: one for spatial information processing and the other for temporal information processing. Convolutional neural networks are employed in each stream. In this research, we apply a lightweight CNN architecture, MobileOne, significantly reducing the model size while demonstrating improved accuracy even with limited computing resources. The model is expected to contribute to a rapid response and prevention of hazardous situations for drivers by being integrated into vehicular driver monitoring systems.

              p
                | Although large corporations have established sales databases for efficient sales activities, small-scale entrepreneurs need a system that provides an interface that anyone can easily manage, offering diverse and complex information. This paper proposes the use of React technology, which can also operate on crawling servers that automatically collect store information. Furthermore, it suggests the development of a responsive web user interface that can be conveniently used in both mouse and keyboard-based desktop environments as well as touch-based smartphone environments, utilizing React technology for the effective delivery of various data. The proposed methods anticipate rapid retrieval of large volumes of data due to the adoption of asynchronous function processing in React technology, an improvement over traditional JavaScript methods.
